1. Create files of varying sizes and record the time it takes to transfer them. Visualize the execution time vs file size. Does the trend make sense?
I created a graph (trend.pdf) that visualizes the time to transfer 7 different file sizes. The trend has a positive slope, which means that as the file size increases, the transfer time increases, which makes sense.

2. What is the main bottleneck that stops the code from transferring files faster? Describe in one or two sentences
The main bottl neck is the buffer capacity. Since every request and response can carry up to m bytes, the file has to be broken into smaller pieces, limiting the throughput, but also allows stability in the transfer.
